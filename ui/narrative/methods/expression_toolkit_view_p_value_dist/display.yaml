    <p>This method display differentially expressed genes' p-value distribution.</p>
     
    <p>Description of filtering methods to do differential Expression: 
        <ul>
        <li>Log odds ratio is a statistical test that calculates the logarithm of the ratio of the odds for regulation to the odds against regulation to measure association between the variables.</li>
        <li>ANOVA: ANalysis Of VAriance is a statistical test for heterogeneity of means by analysis of group variances.</li>
