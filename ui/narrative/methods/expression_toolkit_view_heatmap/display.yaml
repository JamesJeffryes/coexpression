parameters :
    cluster_object :
        ui-name : |
            FeatureCluster
        short-hint : |
            Select the cluster output to be visualized
        long-hint  : |
            Choose a cluster output from your Data Panel to use with this method.
    quantile:
        ui-name : |
            Quantile Level
        short-hint : |
            Santdard deviation quantile of log2 fold change given a cluster
        long-hint  : |
            1.0 means largest std. of log2 fold change and 0.5 mean median lo2 fold change std. given a cluster
    figure_object :
        ui-name : |
            Output figure object name
        short-hint : |
            Provide name for the output FigureProperties object
        long-hint  : |
            Provide name for the output FigureProperties object
    quantile_weight :
        ui-name : |
            Quantile Weight
        short-hint : |
            Provide a relative weight for normalied quantile std. over normalized mean correlation of a cluster
        long-hint  : |
            1.0 means we treat normalized mean correlation to be equal weight to normalized quantile std. and 0.0 means we only consider normalized mean correlation for cluster selection criteria. Please refer to description for more details on normalization.
    min_features :
        ui-name : |
            Minimum Number of Features 
        short-hint : |
            Provide the minimum number of features to visualize
        long-hint  : |
            Provide the minimum number of features to visualize and this method will return features as close as possible to this minimum number of features.
    control_condition :
        ui-name : |
            Input control condition name (Optional)
        short-hint : |
            Provide the name for control condition
        long-hint  : |
            Provide the name for control condition. If not provided, it will use the first sample as a control condition.
